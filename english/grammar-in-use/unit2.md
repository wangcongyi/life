- We use the present simple to talk about things in general. We use it to say that something happens all the time or  
repeatedly, or that something is true in general.  
  - Nurses look after patients in hospitals.  
  - I usually go away at weekends.  
  - The earth goes round the sun.  
  - The cafe opens at 7:30 in the morning.


- We use **do/does** to make questions and negative sentences
  - I come from Canada. Where do you come from?  
  - I don't go away very often.  
  - What does this word mean?  
  - Rice doesn't grow in cold climates.

- Somethimes we do things by saying something. For example, when you promise to do something, you can say **I promise...**  
  - I promise i won't be late. (not I'm promising)
  - What do you suggest i do?
