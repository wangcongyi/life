## Present continuous and present simple (I am doing and I do)

> present continuous(I am doing)  

We use the continuous for things happening at or around the time of speaking. The action is not complete.  

- I've lost my keys again. I'm always losing them. (always doing something = do it too ofen or more often than normal. 并且有埋怨的语气)
- Paul is never satisfied. He's always complaining.
- You're always looking at your phone. Don't you have anything else to do?

> persent simple(I do)  

We use the simple for things in general or things that happen repeatedly.
