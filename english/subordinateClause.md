> 名词从句  Noun clause  

1. 来自陈述句 在最前面加一个无意义的从属连接词 that:  
  He washes his car every day.    
  I believe it.  
  I believe (that) he washes his car every day.


2. 来自特殊疑问句 （who, which, what, when, why, how, where）等引导的疑问句， 疑问词可以直接充当从属连接词：  
  What happened yesterday? 如果疑问词本身就是主语 不用改变顺序   
  What did he say? 如果疑问词不是主语 需要将句子还原 ->> what he said   
  I don't believe what happened yeserday.   
  I don't believe what he said.  


3. 来自一般疑问句 yes/no 改成名词从句必须加上从属连接词 whether：  
  Is it going to rain? 首先改成正常陈述顺序，然后加上从属连接词  
  Whether it is going to rain.  
  I don't know whether it is going to rain (or not).
